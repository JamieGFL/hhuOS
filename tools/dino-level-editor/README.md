# Dino level generator

Website to interactively design levels for the hhuOS dino game. This page is part of Malte Sehmer's bachelor thesis "Development of a 2D game engine for an x86-based operating system".

## Developing

This side is powered by [`sveltekit`](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/introduction) and [`create-svelte`](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/tree/master/packages/create-svelte).
Once you've installed dependencies with `npm install` (or `pnpm install` or `yarn`), start a development server:

```bash
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```

## Building

To create a production version of your app:

```bash
npm run build
```

You can preview the production build with `npm run preview`.
