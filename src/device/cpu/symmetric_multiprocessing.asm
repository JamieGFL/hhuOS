; The APIC implementation is based on a bachelor's thesis, written by Christoph Urlacher.
; The original source code can be found here: https://github.com/ChUrl/hhuOS

; This code is adapted from the OsDev "SMP" page and SerenityOS (and the hhuOS' boot.asm of course):
; https://github.com/SerenityOS/serenity/blob/master/Kernel/Arch/x86_64/Boot/ap_setup.S (visited on 10/02/23).
; This code is relocated by the OS on SMP initialization, so it has to be position independent.
; Because of the relocation, some variables are contained in the .text section, those get initialized
; during runtime.
; The startup is relatively simple (in comparison to the BSP's startup sequence), because we just reuse
; all the stuff already initialized for the BSP (like GDT, IDT, cr0, cr3, cr4).
